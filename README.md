# Tutorials

Each of the tutorials below provides a step by step examination and walkthrough of a specific Fn feature or component.  Check back soon as new tutorials are being added regularly.

## Introduction to Fn
Install Fn and deploy your first functions. Select your language:

* [Go](Introduction/README.md)
* [Java](JavaFDKIntroduction//README.md)
* [Node.js](node/intro/README.md)
* [Ruby](ruby/intro/README.md)
* Python (Coming Soon!)
* Docker (Coming Soon!)

## Explore Fn
* [Create Apps with Fn](Apps/README.md) - Learn how to group your functions into an application/API and deploy them together.
* [Create an Asynchronous Function](Async/README.md) - Learn how to write asynchronous functions for expensive, long running or batch processing.
* [Create a Function with a Docker Container](ContainerAsFunction/README.md) - This tutorial provides a simple example of how to define an Fn function using a custom built Docker container.

## Test and Monitor Functions

* [Write function tests](Testing/README.md) - Fn provides an easy way to write tests for any language, that can ensure you don't break your function contract.
* [Monitor Fn metrics with Grafana and Prometheus](grafana/README.md) - Learn how to view Fn server metrics with Prometheus and Grafana.
* [Troubleshoot functions](Troubleshooting/README.md) - Resolve issues at both development and deployment time.

## Orchestrate with Fn Flow

Fn Flow provides a way to orchestrate functions to build sophisticated applications, initially using Java, and soon with other programming languages.

* [Flow 101](Flow101/README.md)
* [Flow 102](Flow102/README.md)
* [Fn Flow Saga](FlowSaga/README.md) - In this tutorial you will use Fn Flow to implement a Java travel booking system that leverages functions written in a variety of languages.
